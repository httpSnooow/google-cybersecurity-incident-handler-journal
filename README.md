## Project Overview

**Scenario:** A small U.S. health care clinic experienced a severe security incident on a Tuesday morning at 9:00 a.m. Employees reported being unable to access critical medical records, and a ransom note appeared on company computers, demanding payment for a decryption key.

As an incident handler, my task was to document the event using the **Incident Handler's Journal** template, identifying the attack vector, the threat actor, and the impact on business operations to facilitate recovery and future prevention strategies.

## Incident Documentation: The 5 W's

The investigation followed the standard 5 W's framework to capture the essential details of the security breach for the formal record.

| Category | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Who** | An organized group of unethical hackers known for targeting healthcare and transportation industries. |
| **What** | A ransomware security incident that encrypted critical files and medical records, halting business operations. |
| **When** | Tuesday morning, at approximately 9:00 a.m. |
| **Where** | A primary-care health clinic located in the United States. |
| **Why** | Attackers used targeted phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain system access and extort money. |

## Technical Analysis & Findings

The incident was triggered by a social engineering tactic that bypassed initial human defenses.

* **Attack Vector:** Targeted phishing emails were sent to several employees within the clinic.
* **Malware Deployment:** A malicious attachment was downloaded, which installed the ransomware payload on the local machines.
* **Operational Impact:** Total shutdown of computer systems and loss of access to patient data, requiring the clinic to contact external organizations for technical assistance.

---

## Response & Prevention Strategy

Based on the journal entry, the following security questions and considerations were raised to improve the clinic's future security posture:

1.  **Recovery:** Can the company restore data from secure backups instead of complying with the ransom demand?
2.  **Prevention:** How can the clinic implement advanced email filtering and recurring security awareness training to mitigate phishing risks?
3.  **Audit:** What vulnerabilities allowed the malicious attachment to execute without being flagged by endpoint protection?

---

## Key Takeaways

* **Phishing Vulnerability:** Even specialized organizations are targets; technical controls must be paired with continuous employee education.
* **Documentation Protocol:** Using a structured **Incident Handler's Journal** ensures all critical facts are captured under pressure, aiding in legal and technical recovery.
* **Business Continuity:** This scenario emphasizes the critical need for an incident response plan that includes offline data redundancy to prevent total operational shutdown.
